# COVID19-using-Chext-X-ray-Images-in-Keras

I did this project from Coursera platform. The course name is "Classification of COVID19 using Chext X-ray Images in Keras". 
I learnt to Build and Train the Convolutional Neural Network using Keras with Tensorflow as Backend  by implementing a CNN to differentiate between chest x rays images with a COVID 19 infections versus without, to Visualize Data in Matplotlib and to make use of the Trained Model to Predict on a New Set of Data.
